This is my portfolio project, built using React.js and Threejs

I have included the beginnings of a CMS using a .NET Functions application. Currently the DataLoader functions in place of what 
would be an api client that would fetch the content from blob storage, but as this backend is not deployed, I have simulated this by reading and writing to in-memory JSON files.

Currently, projects are only readable, but to extend this, I would include an admin page to the front-end application which would allow for adding of new projects and experience.
